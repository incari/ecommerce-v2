  longDescription:
    "\u003Cp\u003EA \u003Cstrong\u003Evacation package to Botswana will open up a world of wildlife\u003C/strong\u003E, landscapes and a friendly culture to all who are lucky enough to explore this vibrant country. Landlocked between Namibia, Zambia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, Botswana has a fantastically varied terrain including the plains of the arid Kalahari Desert, which covers up to 10% of the country, and the lush wetlands of the Okavango Delta.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen traveling to Botswana, visitors will receive a \u003Cstrong\u003Ewarm welcome from the population\u003C/strong\u003E, made up of different tribal groups as the country is said to be one of the safest and friendliest in the whole of Africa. Most of the world’s ‘San’ population call the lands of Botswana their home.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEnglish is the most widely spoken language of the Botswana\u003C/strong\u003E, the name given to the people of Botswana, although Setswana is the local tongue.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESince the country became independent in 1966, the economy has seen remarkable growth thanks to its \u003Cstrong\u003Eabundant natural resources\u003C/strong\u003E, meaning that Botswana is one of the \u003Cstrong\u003Emore wealthy countries in Africa\u003C/strong\u003E. Almost all escorted tours of Botswana will focus on the vast national parks, some of the richest in the region and considered the most exclusive safari destinations, as Botswana has aimed for quality over quantity when it comes to tourism. \u003Cstrong\u003E38% of the country is designated national reserve land\u003C/strong\u003E and animals roam freely without borders or restrictions.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth the Chobe National Park and the Okavango Delta are home to a plethora of wildlife such as lions, crocodiles, cheetahs, hippos, elephants and wild dogs making them the perfect destinations for \u003Cstrong\u003Esafari holidays\u003C/strong\u003E. Aside from the national parks, the Makgadikgadi Salt Pan is another unmissable natural attraction; an impressive landscape of crisp white land and one of the world’s largest. \u003Cstrong\u003EBotswana is also known for its diamond mines\u003C/strong\u003E, concentrated in the Jwaneng area where the world’s richest diamond mine is located. Many \u003Cstrong\u003Etours of Botswana will begin in either Gaborone\u003C/strong\u003E, the capital city which is home to most of the population and located in the southeast of the country, or Maun, a once tiny village that now serves as a gateway to the wonderful national parks and safari routes. Visitors will be enchanted by the untouched landscapes that serve to open one's eyes to how abundant nature can be when left to flourish.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBotswana has the highest population of elephants in Africa\u003C/strong\u003E, so nature lovers can enjoy admiring these gentle giants, particularly around the Chobe River area. Lovers of adventure can experience 4x4 rides in the Kalahari, canoe trips on the Chobe River and bush walks in the many game reserves.\u003C/p\u003E",

        '\u003Cp\u003ETo discover the meaning of the popular festivals in Botswana, you must first know that this country has a rich cultural heritage. The festivities in Botswana continue to be celebrated as they were hundreds of years ago, and they follow the principles of ancestral tradition and culture.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe festivities and popular festivals in Botswana depend on the diverse ethnic groups which inhabit the country. The Herero, the Kavango, the Khoisan, the Lozi, the Ndebele, the Shoto, and the Tswana are the main ethnic groups which make up the original population of Botswana.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThese men and women have managed to avoid the collapse of the colonial era and tribal conflicts. Dominated by the absolutism of family monarchies for centuries, however, it was not a source of slaves, unlike many other African countries. Its political institutions have been modernized, and debates replace tribal clashes.\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlthough there are inequalities in the quality of life among the different ethnic groups, the country has managed to maintain peace, being a safe destination for millions of tourists.
